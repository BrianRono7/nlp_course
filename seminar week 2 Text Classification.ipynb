A new method,\\ncalled, diagonal based feature extraction is introduced for extracting the\\nfeatures of the handwritten alphabets. Fifty data sets, each containing 26\\nalphabets written by various people, are used for training the neural network\\nand 570 different handwritten alphabetical characters are used for testing. The\\nproposed recognition system performs quite well yielding higher levels of\\nrecognition accuracy compared to the systems employing the conventional\\nhorizontal and vertical methods of feature extraction. This system will be\\nsuitable for converting handwritten documents into structural text form and\\nrecognizing handwritten names.\",\n          \"Context: Characterization of instrumental effects in astronomical imaging is\\nimportant in order to extract accurate physical information from the\\nobservations. The measured image in a real optical instrument is usually\\nrepresented by the convolution of an ideal image with a Point Spread Function\\n(PSF). Additionally, the image acquisition process is also contaminated by\\nother sources of noise (read-out, photon-counting). The problem of estimating\\nboth the PSF and a denoised image is called blind deconvolution and is\\nill-posed.\\n  Aims: We propose a blind deconvolution scheme that relies on image\\nregularization. Contrarily to most methods presented in the literature, our\\nmethod does not assume a parametric model of the PSF and can thus be applied to\\nany telescope.\\n  Methods: Our scheme uses a wavelet analysis prior model on the image and weak\\nassumptions on the PSF. We use observations from a celestial transit, where the\\nocculting body can be assumed to be a black disk. These constraints allow us to\\nretain meaningful solutions for the filter and the image, eliminating trivial,\\ntranslated and interchanged solutions. Under an additive Gaussian noise\\nassumption, they also enforce noise canceling and avoid reconstruction\\nartifacts by promoting the whiteness of the residual between the blurred\\nobservations and the cleaned data.\\n  Results: Our method is applied to synthetic and experimental data. The PSF is\\nestimated for the SECCHI/EUVI instrument using the 2007 Lunar transit, and for\\nSDO/AIA using the 2012 Venus transit. Results show that the proposed\\nnon-parametric blind deconvolution method is able to estimate the core of the\\nPSF with a similar quality to parametric methods proposed in the literature. We\\nalso show that, if these parametric estimations are incorporated in the\\nacquisition model, the resulting PSF outperforms both the parametric and\\nnon-parametric methods.\",\n          \"In a context where most published articles are devoted to the development of\\n\\\"new methods\\\", comparison studies are generally appreciated by readers but\\nsurprisingly given poor consideration by many scientific journals. In\\nconnection with recent articles on over-optimism and epistemology published in\\nBioinformatics, this letter stresses the importance of neutral comparison\\nstudies for the objective evaluation of existing methods and the establishment\\nof standards by drawing parallels with clinical research.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tag\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[{'term': 'stat.CO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.NE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]\",\n          \"[{'term': 'cs.CV', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.SR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]\",\n          \"[{'term': 'stat.CO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.CV', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.ME', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.ML', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Diagonal Based Feature Extraction for Handwritten Alphabets Recognition\\n  System using Neural Network\",\n          \"Non-parametric PSF estimation from celestial transit solar images using\\n  blind deconvolution\",\n          \"A Plea for Neutral Comparison Studies in Computational Sciences\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 2011,\n        \"max\": 2016,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2011,\n          2014,\n          2012\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe"},"text/html":["\n","  \u003cdiv id=\"df-666ee352-bdf6-41b5-8ccf-fcc2d7fa0faa\" class=\"colab-df-container\"\u003e\n","    \u003cdiv\u003e\n","\u003cstyle scoped\u003e\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","\u003c/style\u003e\n","\u003ctable border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\"\u003e\n","  \u003cthead\u003e\n","    \u003ctr style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eauthor\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eday\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eid\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003elink\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003emonth\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003esummary\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003etag\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003etitle\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eyear\u003c/th\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","  \u003c/thead\u003e\n","  \u003ctbody\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e20445\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e[{'name': 'D.

Therefore, its' perplexity will be lower than it should when encountering such words. Therefore, comparing it with a model with fewer unknown words will not be fair. When implementing your own smoothing, you may handle this by adding a virtual `UNK` token of non-zero probability. Technically, this will result in a model where probabilities do not add up to $1$, but it is close enough for a practice excercise."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"0ljSFo-4G48G"},"outputs":[],"source":["#test that it's a valid probability model\n","for n in (1, 2, 3):\n","    dummy_lm = LaplaceLanguageModel(dummy_lines, n=n)\n","    assert np.allclose(sum([dummy_lm.get_next_token_prob('a', w_i) for w_i in dummy_lm.vocab]), 1), \"I told you not to break anything! :)\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":81018,"status":"ok","timestamp":1761444508513,"user":{"displayName":"Craven psycho","userId":"11852007366426381956"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"8h3G6ZfOG48H","outputId":"d34192b8-28cb-4b26-d0e9-b0fa833d1a05"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["N = 1, Perplexity = 1832.66878\n","N = 2, Perplexity = 470.48021\n","N = 3, Perplexity = 3679.44765\n"]}],"source":["for n in (1, 2, 3):\n","    lm = LaplaceLanguageModel(train_lines, n=n, delta=0.1)\n","    ppx = perplexity(lm, test_lines)\n","    print(\"N = %i, Perplexity = %.5f\" % (n, ppx))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"GvXSHGUcG48I"},"outputs":[],"source":["# optional: try to sample tokens from such a model"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bi57WfCIG48K"},"source":["### Kneser-Ney smoothing (2 points)\n","\n","Additive smoothing is simple, reasonably good but definitely not a State of The Art algorithm.\n","\n","\n","Your final task in this notebook is to implement [Kneser-Ney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneser%E2%80%93Ney_smoothing) smoothing.\n","\n","It can be computed recurrently, for n\u003e1:\n","\n","$$P_{kn}(w_t | prefix_{n-1}) = { \\max(0, Count(prefix_{n-1}, w_t) -
